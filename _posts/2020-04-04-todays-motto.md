## Success as a developer is going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm.


## Another inspiring post by Catalin Pit from twitter

- There's always a better programmer.
- There's always a shinner project.
- There's always a better-paid developer.
- There's always a more popular one.
- There's always someone better.

But you don't care. You admire them, but you focus on improving yourself.
You run your race.
